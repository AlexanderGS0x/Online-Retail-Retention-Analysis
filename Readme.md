# Online Retail Customer Retention Analysis

This is a capstone project analyzing customer retention for an online retail business, completed as part of my data analytics learning journey.

## Project Overview
- **Business Task**: Analyze customer purchase data to understand retention patterns and propose strategies to improve customer loyalty.
- **Data**: Online retail transaction data (sourced from the dataset `OnlineRetail.csv`).
- **Tools**: RStudio (R Markdown for analysis and visualizations).
- **Key Findings**:
  - Most customers buy only once, but a small group of repeat buyers drives sales.
  - The top spenders average higher transaction values (e.g., top customer averages $77,183.60 per transaction).
- **Recommendations**:
  1. Offer discounts to one-time buyers to encourage repeat purchases.
  2. Reward top spenders with loyalty perks.
